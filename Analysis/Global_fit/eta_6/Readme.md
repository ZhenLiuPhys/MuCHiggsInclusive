Here are the MMA file for forward muon eta<6

Higgs_11p_fit_MuC_cepc_HLLHC_2023.nb is the global fit including \kappa_\Gamma, but doesn't include Br_{unt}.
Higgs_11p_fit_MuC_cepc_HLLHC_2023.nb is the global fit including Br_{unt}, but doesn't include \kappa_\Gamma.
The upper two files produce Table V.


Higgs_11p_plot_maker.nb produces the plot FIG.7.
