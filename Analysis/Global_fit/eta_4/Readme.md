Here are the MMA file for forward muon eta<4

Higgs_11p_fit_MuC_cepc_HLLHC_2023_eta4.nb is the global fit including \kappa_\Gamma, but doesn't include Br_{unt}. 
Higgs_11p_fit_MuC_cepc_HLLHC_2023_BSM_br_eta4.nb is the global fit including Br_{unt}, but doesn't include \kappa_\Gamma. 
The upper two files produce the left side of Table V and VII.
